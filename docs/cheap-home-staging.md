Staging
: The process of making a home more appealing when trying to sell.  Staging usually involves cleaning, decluttering, furnishing, and decorating.  To understand why staging is important, read [this article by the National Association of Realtors](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/profile-of-home-staging). 

## The cost of professional staging
The cost of professional staging is not a one-time fee.  Decor and furnishings are rented to the home owner, usually for a set monthly amount.  The monthly amount may be for the entire house, or each room may be billed at a rate per room.  Homeowners may also be locked into a contract for a minimum number of months.

According to [a recent article on Realtor.com](https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/how-much-does-home-staging-cost/) the cost for a fully-staged, 2000 square foot home could be as high as $2400 per month.

## The cost of DIY staging
When going the DIY route, home owners can still expect to have some cost associated with staging, but this amount can be drastically reduced. Focusing on the steps below can greatly increase DIY staging efforts and result in a home that sells quickly – without a monthly obligation to a professional staging company.

### Start with a good palette
Staging is _not_ the same as maintenance, and decor can only go so far when obvious maintenance issues exist.  Fix anything that is easily fixed, and give (at least) the common rooms – kitchen, living room, main bedroom and bath – a fresh coat of paint.  

For big ticket maintenance items, like windows that need replacing, homeowners may expect to make a few concessions following a home inspection, since dilapidated windows _will_ be a line item on any home inspection.  However, knowing this doesn't mean ignoring those ugly windows during staging.  Installing inexpensive, white vinyl blinds can help conceal outdated windows and allow potential buyers to focus on positive items within the home. 

### Use your own furniture but declutter
Use your own furniture, but remove something from every room.  This not only jumpstarts the decluttering process, it provides a chance to move furniture out of the house, something that eventually needs to happen anyway.  Some per-room tips for success:

* Livingroom – keep the couch and coffee table, lose the loveseat or recliner
* Bedrooms – keep the beds and nightstands, lose the dressers
* Dining room – keep the table and chairs, lose any self-standing cabinets or buffets
* Home office – keep the desk and bookshelf, lose any filing cabinets, printers or extra stands/chairs
* Bathrooms – keep everything that's attached, lose self-standing towel racks, magazine holders, toilet paper holders, and anything that's not attached

These are suggestions, not hard rules, but removing extra items allows even a DIY stager to begin to see the true home palette.  This makes it easier to decide what decorative items to keep or add.

**NOTE: DIY staging is most easily done when a homeowner is still living in the house to be sold.** However, this also creates challenges for every day living: where to put items that are removed, and where to find those items if they are needed. 

One way to tackle this is to designate a room, or garage, for storing any furniture or personal items that are removed during the decluttering phase.  This keeps those items easily accessible, without interfering with the overall staging process.

Renting a storage unit is another option. But if saving money is essential, a storage room _in_ the home beats the effort and cost of renting and moving extra items to a storage unit.

### Remove family photos and personal items
When adding a fresh coat of paint, wallhangings will naturally be removed from the walls.  This is the time to pack family photos and anything overly personal – diplomas, kids' drawings, refrigerator magnets, things that contain family intials.  

Do the same with personal items and photos that are sitting throughout the house, like on bookshelves and coffee tables. 

If possible, do the same with clothes hanging in closets.  Closets don't need to be completely empty, but removing a third to half of all clothing – while also packing away the removed items – makes closets appear larger and organized. 

Remove or hide prescriptions and other medication.  This may seem like an unnecessary step, but prescription bottles should not be viewable – or accessible – to potential buyers touring a home.  

Do the same with personal mail and magazine subscriptions that display a family name.

### Keep decorating essentials
Throw pillows and blankets, candles and candle holders, doormats, area rugs, table and floor lamps, non-personal wall hangings, vases, barstools, decorative mirrors, curtains (if tasteful and modern) – all of these can be reused when staging.  

This is also an opportunity to purchase a few new items that to keep and use in the new home – some upgraded throw pillows, a modern table centerpiece, decorative baskets.  This doesn't need to be a long list or a large investment.  Choose items that should be replaced anyway, essential items that every home needs. 

**PRO TIP:** Most picture frames come with generic photos. If picture frames are on the list of items to replace, keep the generic photos intact and use them as-is to stage bookshelves, mantles and walls.

Decorate the eye-attracting areas:
* **Bookshelves** – keep a minimal number of books and add a candle, vase or generic photo 
* **Fireplace mantles** – add bold, framed wall art, along with minimal knick-knacks
* **Bathroom counters** – keep minimal, generic bathroom products, like hand-soap and hand towel, add a vase with faux foliage (or real flowers, if available)
* **Bathrooms in general** – hang nice towels on towel racks, purchase and hang new shower curtains  
* **Kitchen counters** – leave only _essential_ appliances like the microwave and coffee maker, add a bowl of fresh fruit
* **Dining room table** – add a centerpiece and placemats

### Add DIY crafts
Are there wall or other areas that seem _empty_?  Don't spend money to _purchase_ more home decor if it can be _made_ instead.

Pinterest is full of inspiration for taking common household items and transforming them.

Fill a vase with wine corks
Take ugly wall art and paint over it or cover it with shelf paper patterned after old floorboards
