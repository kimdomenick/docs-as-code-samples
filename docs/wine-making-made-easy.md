<details><summary>Purchase a kit</summary>
<p>
In addition to ingredients, specialized wine-making tools and equipment are necessary to get started.  These are not necessarily items you have around the house: a hydrometer, glass carboys, and airlocks are just a few.  This is where purchasing a first-time wine-making kit is helpful.
</p>
<p>
  [Kits like this one](https://www.midwestsupplies.com/products/master-vintnerr-fresh-harvestr-fruit-winemaking-kit) come with all the ingredients to make your first batch of wine, along with basic equipment and additives you'll use in future batches.

  Here are [some additional kits for 1 gallon winemaking](https://www.midwestsupplies.com/collections/small-batch-wine-making-kit) available at Midwest Supplies.

<details><summary>Purchase a real corker</summary>
<p>
Bottling and corking finished wine is nearly impossible using cheap, hand-held corkers.  Most hobby wine makers recommend a floor model such as this one:

<details><summary>Try some unusual recipes</summary>
<p>Some of the best learning experiences come from making strange or unusual wines that aren't made with grapes.</p>
<p>A few non-traditional wine ideas:</p>
1. Floral wines made with Honeysuckle or Dandelion
2. Fruit wines made with local farmer's market ingredients
3. Berry wines made with wild raspberries or blackberries
4. Wine from grocery store bottled juice

<details><summary>Keep a journal</summary>
<p>
Thoroughly document steps and recipes along the way.  This should include:
</p>
1. Ingredients and ingredient amounts, including type of wine yeast and any additives (nutrient, acid blend, etc.)
2. Starting figures â€“ specific gravity, PH, volume
3. Dates when wine is racked, filtered, fined, back-sweetened (if applicable), bottled, etc.
4. Ingredients/additives used to fine and back-sweeten (if applicable)
5. Results. What did the wine taste like at bottling, at 6 months, an 12 months, and so on

<details><summary>Have fun!</summary>
<p>Possibly the most important step in the process: fun!</p>
<p>Although it's an exercise in patience, home wine making can be very rewarding. It's a little science, a little math, and a little treat at the end.</p>
<p>After a few years of building a stock of various wines, and allowing them to age, there will always be something interesting in the wine cellar to share with friends and family.  And everyone will know what they're getting for Christmas.</p>
